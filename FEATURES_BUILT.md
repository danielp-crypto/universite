2. Add your API key to environment variables
3. The frontend will automatically use real transcription

### Settings Functionality
Basic settings structure is in place. Can be enhanced with:
- Theme switching (dark/light mode)
- Notification preferences
- Storage management UI
- User profile editing

```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python api.py
   ```

2. **Open Frontend:**
   - Open any HTML file in a browser
   - Make sure `js/app-state.js` is accessible
   - Backend should be running on `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Record a Lecture:**
   - Go to Assistant page
   - Click "Record Lecture" or "Upload Recording"
   - Audio will be recorded/uploaded
   - Currently uses mock data (transcription API key needed)

4. **Study with Flashcards:**
   - Record or upload a lecture
   - Go to Flashcards page
   - Flashcards are auto-generated from lecture content
   - Study and track your progress

5. **Chat with AI:**
   - Record a lecture first
   - Use the chat interface to ask questions
   - AI uses lecture context for responses

## 🔑 API Keys Needed

1. **Google Gemini API** ✅ (Already configured)
   - Key: `AIzaSyAqpapZgs2z9oussNPp68ssXeVGIRf25qo`
   - Used for: Chat responses, flashcard generation

2. **Audio Transcription API** ⏳ (Pending)
   - When available, update `/api/transcribe` endpoint in `api.py`
   - Supports: Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, or other services

## 📝 Notes

- All data is stored locally in browser localStorage
- No database required for basic functionality
- Backend handles AI API calls securely
- Frontend is fully functional with mock data when APIs unavailable
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

## ✅ Auth Build (Latest)

- **Auth guard** on all app pages: home, lectures, assistant, flashcards, settings, notes, search, lecture-detail
- **User-scoped app state**: localStorage key includes Supabase user ID; each user sees only their lectures, notes, flashcards
- **Sign out** in Settings page; redirects to login

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. ~~Add user authentication~~ (done via Supabase)
2. Cloud storage integration
3. Real-time collaboration
4. Advanced analytics
5. Export to PDF/Word
6. Mobile app version
7. Offline mode support
