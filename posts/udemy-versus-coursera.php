    <h1>Udemy vs Coursera: Which Platform Is Better in 2025?</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>In the rapidly evolving world of online education, two platforms have emerged as clear leaders: Udemy and Coursera. Both offer thousands of courses and have helped millions of learners worldwide, but they serve distinctly different educational needs and learning styles. This comprehensive comparison will help you understand which platform aligns best with your learning goals, budget, and career aspirations in 2025.</p>

    <h2>🎓 Platform Overview & Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Understanding the fundamental differences between these platforms is crucial for making an informed decision. Udemy operates as a marketplace model where anyone can create and sell courses, focusing on practical skills and immediate applicability. Coursera, on the other hand, partners with top universities and organizations to offer structured, academic-style learning experiences with formal credentials.</p>

    <h2>👥 Community & Support</h2>
    <h3>Udemy Community</h3>
